Holistic Nash equilbrium (Honey) describes a notion of equilibrium that arises
in an admissions market where schools have a preference order over the powerset
of students. Each school designates an admissions policy indicating which students
it will accept, and students go to their favorite school among those whose
admissions policy admits them. The admissions policies constitute an equilibrium
when no school can achieve higher utility by adopting a different admissions policy.
School utility functions are derived from the preference language proposed by Othman
et al. (2010), which allows for a combination of additive utility and complementarity
or substitution effects.
